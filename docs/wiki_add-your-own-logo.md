title: "Wiki Add Your Own Logo"
---

As the official instructions for the theme explain (see: [*http://monobook.wikidot.com/doc:features#toc1 Adding a Logo]), your logo must be an image with dimensions 150x150.

We've already added this to your wiki's CSS:

```
/* Show a logo for the wiki */

#header h1 a, #header h1 a:hover{
    background-image:url(/local--files/start/wiki-logo-150.png);
}

#container{
    background-image:url(http://monobook.wikidot.com/local--files/index/monobook-header.gif);
}
```

To change the logo you either:

# Go to the [/start welcome page] and upload a file named wiki-logo-150.png with dimensions 150px by 150px, or
# Upload a file to a different location or with a different filename, and edit the CSS to reflect these changes

## Editing the CSS

You can edit the CSS using [/admin:manage Site Manager].

# Site Manager
# Appearance
# Custom Themes _
[/admin:manage/start/customthemes (Direct Link to Custom Themes)] [*/admin:manage/start/customthemes (Open Custom Themes in a new tab/window)]
# Click "edit" next to the theme titled {{monobook-fereal}}
# Find the following line: {{@@#header h1 a; #header h1 a:hover{@@}}
# Edit the {{background-image:url}} option so that it has the correct URL
# Save the changes
